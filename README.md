# Jtoggle
[Jtoggle](#latest-release) by EnderArchery

Allows you to "lock" your `Ctrl` and `Shift` keys in place, so you don't have to hold them down anymore.
I order to trigger the lock, press the key you want to toggle once and very quick.
If you hold them down longer, it won't trigger. You should even be able to type with it enabled.
In order to unlock the key, just press it again.
